         * Greedy thoughts have been applied to this question, greedy is not just about caring the biggest,
         * but about it tries the earliest possible solu, and once it fails, it will jump forward past the whole failed region
         * 
         * This is greedy because at each failure, we make the locally optimal choice of skipping the failed block entirely, 
         * never reconsidering those indices. We are greedy in discarding the impossible interval as a whole.
         * 
         * Suppose you are currently testing starting point s.
         * At some index k, you find that the running tank (cumulative gas âˆ’ cost from s to k) becomes negative.
         * We want to know at t where s <= t <= k, is there any t can work?
         * P(t, k) = P(s, k) - P(s, t - 1)
         * since P(s, t-1) is surely > 0 o/w it gonna stop at t-1 not t, therefore:
         * P(t, k) <= P(s, k) < 0, thus this is why we can skip invalid range at once
